# Icon Browser

Beginning with Backdrop CMS version 1.28, Backdrop CMS comes bundled with two variants of the [Phosphor library](https://phosphoricons.com/) of SVG icons and a new icon API which will make it easier to add icons to Backdrop CMS sites. Backdrop Core does not contain any user interface for using or accessing these icons.

The Icon Browser module provides a UI to view the icons made available by core and any SVG icons provided by contributed modules or themes. The icon browser also provides code snippets for easy use of the available SVG icons in your themes or modules.

As of this writing, this module is very much a work in progress.
